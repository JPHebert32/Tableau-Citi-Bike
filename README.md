The two phenomena I explored was, Rider Type, and Gender. The rider type phenomena shows the different usage between short term riders (1 or 3 day passes),
and Subscribers. The biggest trend discoverd was that short term riders spend more time each trip, and are most likley to falseify their data.

I also looked at the demogroghics of the riders.
